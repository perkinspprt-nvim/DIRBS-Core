# PostgreSQL settings used to build connection string
postgresql:
  # Database name (an empty database on the first run). Overridden by environment
  # variable DIRBS_DB_DATABASE if set.
  database: dirbs
  # Host that the PostgreSQL server runs on. Overridden by environment
  # variable DIRBS_DB_HOST if set.
  host: localhost
  # PostgreSQL port if not running on standard port of 5432. Overridden by environment
  # variable DIRBS_DB_PORT if set.

  # Database role/user that DIRBS will connect to PostgreSQL as. Overridden by environment
  # variable DIRBS_DB_USER if set.
  user: dirbs
  # Password used to connect to the database.
  #
  # There are a number of ways to set the password, with each option having pros and cons
  # dependent on the level of security required vs. ability to automate
  #   - Firstly, the password can be defined here in clear text. This file would
  #     then have its permissions set appropriately to restrict access to non-admin
  #     users
  #   - If the setting is not defined in this config file, the user's .pgpass file
  #     will be read from their home directory. Note that this file will only be
  #     read if its permissions are set appropriately (must only be readable by the user)
  #   - If the DIRBS_DB_PASSWORD environment variable is set, this value will
  #     overwrite any value configured in here or in .pgpass
  #   - Finally, the --db-password-prompt command-line option can be used to prompt
  #     the user for a password when a command is run.
  #
  # Uncomment the below line to set the password explicitly in this config file
  #
  # password: <change me>

# Definitions of configuration variables used by DIRBS Core to determine how many workers to use to parallelise
multiprocessing:
  # The maximum number of local processing blade workers to use to achieve DIRBS Core tasks. This is particularly

  # The maximum number of database connections to use to parallelise DIRBS Core tasks. PostgreSQL 9.6 has support
  # for parellelising tasks internally - this setting does not affect parellelisation for a single connection.
  # Where PostgreSQL is unable to parallelise a single query by itself, we use this number of workers to issue
  # multiple queries at once on different connections. Generally this scales very well - it is safe to set this
  # reasonably high. It should probably be set to roughly the number of disks in your RAID array in case there are
  # I/O intensive DB operations going on. If using SSD, can be set to a higher value.

# Definition of conditions used by the DIRBS system. There are zero or more
# conditions used to drive the classification. A system with zero conditions
# does no classification at all
conditions:
  # Each condition specifies the following properties
  #   label: A name for the condition. This is the id/key for the condition. If
  #     this is changed, all previous classifications will be reset. Likewise,
  #     if you change the dimensions but keep the condition label the same,
  #     existing classifications for that condition will be retained.
  #   dimensions: A list of dimensions whose intersection forms the IMEI set
  #     result for the condition. Each of these can take parameters that
  #     are particular for the dimension being used. Additionally, they all
  #     accept an 'invert' property, which basically NOTs the result of the
  #     dimension by taking the all-time observed IMEIs list and subtracting the
  #     set of IMEIs returned by this dimension
  #   grace_period_days: The integer number of days that an IMEI failing
  #     this condition will remain on the notification list before moving
  #     to the black list.
  #   blocking: A boolean stating whether this condition contributes to
  #     list generation or is simply informational. Information conditions
  #     can be used to try out new modules or to tweak parameters.
  #   reason: A string sent to the operators describing why the IMEI is
  #     to be blacklisted.
  #   max_allowed_matching_ratio: The maximum percentage of all-time seen IMEIs
  #     this condition is allowed to match. This is a safety check implemented
  #     to catch a missing GSMA TAC DB, registration list, etc.
  #
