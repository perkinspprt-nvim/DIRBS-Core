# Definitions of configuration variables related to pruning of subscriber data

    # The number of days for which an IMEI in blacklist have not been active on the network
    # will be removed/pruned from blacklist. The IMEI will be allowed to function on the network
    # again. If it meets a condition again after being pruned from the blacklist, it will be given
    # a new grace period and then put back on the blacklist. The default value of blacklist retention is
    # 0 which means nothing will expire from blacklist ever. For safety this period (in days) should be longer than

# Definitions of configuration variables used by DIRBS Core to determine how many workers to use to parallelise
multiprocessing:
  # The maximum number of local processing blade workers to use to achieve DIRBS Core tasks. This is particularly
  # useful for pre-validation of large operator import jobs where we can run multiple instances of the pre-validator
  # in parallel on different parts of the file. The default is to use half of the available CPUs in the
  # system will be used.
  # max_local_cpus: 10
  # The maximum number of database connections to use to parallelise DIRBS Core tasks. PostgreSQL 9.6 has support
  # for parellelising tasks internally - this setting does not affect parellelisation for a single connection.
  # Where PostgreSQL is unable to parallelise a single query by itself, we use this number of workers to issue
  # multiple queries at once on different connections. Generally this scales very well - it is safe to set this
  # reasonably high. It should probably be set to roughly the number of disks in your RAID array
