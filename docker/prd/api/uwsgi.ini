# Catches typos in option names in this file. By default, uwsgi will accept anything you write in this file and
# simply ignore invalid values. This is a pain when it comes to tracking down problems, so enable strict
# validation of this config file
strict

# Run an HTTP server on port 5000, which will load balance requests across workers. If you are running this
# behind nginx/apache, this can be changed to socket or http-socket but there is no performance improvement
# in doing this
http = :5000

# Enable the uWSGI master process
master = true

# Set appropriate number of workers -- for the Core API workload, a good rule of thumb is that this should be about
# 2x the number of cores
processes = 40

# Set the maximum connection queue length for the TCP/IP socket. This should be based on the number of concurrent
# requests the server expects to receive at once. Setting should be max_concurrent_connections_expected - workers.
# The below requires an increased kernel limit for net.core.somaxconn. To do this pass the CLI
# option "--sysctl net.core.somaxconn=4096" to docker run. By default this is 128 and the listen value is 100
# which is a bit low for web applications
listen = 2048

# Tell uwsgi where the DIRBS Core app is located and how to call into it
virtualenv = /home/dirbs/dirbs-venv

# Socket used for storing stats. This allows utilities like uwsgitop to read data from the socket and give
# performance information on how uwsgi is performing
stats = /tmp/stats.socket

# Enabled thunder lock to address thundering herd
# (http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/articles/SerializingAccept.html)

# Sets the log format to be logged to the Docker container's stdout

# Enables memory reporting so that per-process memory reporting can be monitored

# During testing, we found that uwsgi generated errors in some testing tools (JMeter) when HTTP 1.1 Keep-alives
# are used in the JMeter config. This is because JMeter expects that a conformant server will always
# return a Connection header in the response if a connection keepalive is requested. To be more conformant,
# we return a "Connection: close" header to indicate that connections should not be recycled since
# keepalives do not seem to be reliably supported in uwsgi (coming in next version)
add-header = Connection: close
